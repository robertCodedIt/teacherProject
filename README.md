# MERN To-Do List 
### A ToDo app in React for Instructor Qualification Exam
<hr/> 

#### Problem Domain
    Create a full stack application that incorporates the principles and ideas of code-102, code-201, and code-301
<hr/>

#### Solution
    Personally, I often  find myself trying to recount all the things I need to get done. I decided to code a Todo List because I knew I could perform all the CRUD operations and setup handlers for all those with one core component having much of the  functionalty required to complete this assessment.

#### Technologies Used
### Backend
- MongoDB : Used MongoDB to Persist the API data
    - The database that allow users to perform the CRUD operations with persistence
    - NoSQL, Easy to learn and intuitive
    
- Express JS : Used ExpressJS to stage the API for CRUD operations

    - The server of the application. 
    - Fast and reliable API setup
    - JavaScript friendly

- NodeJS : Used NodeJS to run the server and serve the API data

    - The run time of the server and client
    - The Event Loop makes the engine fast and very responsive to asynchronous code

- CORS : Used cors so my client-facing application can make HTTP requests to the server application

    - In order for server to share resources with the client on the same local machine, the server has to allow cors or cross-origin-resource-sharing. cors is the module that we import to allow cerain routes to be shared with the client.

### Front End
- ReactJS : Used React to make the UI of the application

    - The client facing application.
    - arranges the UI into self contained components
    - Virtual DOM - refreshes the components
    - Easy to use

- Axios : Used Axios to make an API call to the appliction's server

    - Axios has the same API for the client and server side, so it is very intuitive
    - Used to make HTTP requests and give HTTP responses

- Auth0 : Used Auth0 to authenticate users


### Styling
- React-Bootstrap 
- CSS 5
